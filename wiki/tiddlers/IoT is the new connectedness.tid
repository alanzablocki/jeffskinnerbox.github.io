title: IoT is the new connectedness
type: text/x-markdown

Connected.
Seems to be the name of the age we live in.

Location - where is my stuff
Connected - communicating with things
Sense - orientation, speed, etc

_**The Internet of Things isn't about things at all.
It's about bring remote physical experience into our consciousness.**_
