- This mechanical wave generator illustrates wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection and impedance matching.

[[Harmonic Analyzer|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAsM30MAHLg]]
- A nineteenth century mechanical computer that performed Fourier analysis by using gears, springs and levers to calculate with sines and cosines.

AT&T produced the video "[[Seeing the Digital Future|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avHo0-qU8xo]]" and
brags about things like the Data-Phone which could transmit
at up to a bit-rate of 110 bits per second.

[[Mechanical Computer|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1i-dnAH9Y4]]
- Mathematical computation via mechanical form is discussed for fire control computer aboard Navy Ships.

[[Popular Electronics Magazine|http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Popular-Electronics-Guide.htm]]
- Popular Electronics was created in 1954 by Ziff-Davis Publishing for an audience of  electronics hobbyists and experimenters.
It became Computers & Electronics in November, 1982

[[Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS)|http://hackaday.com/2014/12/02/retrotechtacular-ma-bells-advanced-mobile-phone-service-amps/]] - The first-generation cellular technology from AT&T

[[The Boy Electrician|http://www.tayloredge.com/museum/museum/TheBoyElectrician.pdf]] is an introduction to electricity and magnetism from a time when you could still build things at home that worked just like commercial gear.

[[Foxhole Radio|http://bizarrelabs.com/foxhole.htm]]
where built by GI's, during World War Two, which took advantage of readily available materials.

The [[Pascaline|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h71HAJWnVU]]
was the first successful mechanical calculator. It was developed in the 1640's by the mathematician Blaise Pascal.

From the mid-40s until the 90s,
[[Heathkit|http://hackaday.com/2014/12/22/the-heathkit-mystery/]]
was the brand for electronic kits ranging from test equipment, ~HiFis, amateur radio equipment, to computers. Their departure was a tragic loss.

A [[teleprinter|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcMHam54EOI#t=516]]
(teletypewriter, Teletype or TTY) is an electromechanical typewriter that can be used to send and receive typed messages from point to point and point to multipoint over various types of communications channels.
Teleprinters were invented in order to send and receive messages without the need for operators trained in the use of Morse code.

This training film on [[Basic Telephony|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKfa27PTE_s#t=29]]
(and it's [[part 2|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKvllL2zxGo]])
describes the common household telephone prior to todays digital telephony.

The [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) System|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06drBN8nlWg]],
was designed and built in the 1950s to defend against the threat
of Soviet bombers attacking the continental United States.

The [[UNIX Operating System|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0]]
was developed to make the job of creating software systems easier,
and in general, make the interaction of computers with people easier.
This productivity gain was taken further with the introduction of the
[[Blit|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr1XXvSaVUQ]], an early windowed graphic interface for Unix.

Silicon Valley, or as it was formerlly know,
[[Valley of the Hearts Delight|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_Valley]],
is in some ways retro.
See the article "[[To Invent the Future, You Must Understand the Past|https://medium.com/backchannel/why-silicon-valley-will-continue-to-rule-c0cbb441e22f]]".

Before [[Pong|http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3900/the_history_of_pong_avoid_missing_.php?print=1]],
there was [[Tennis for Two|http://www.engineering.com/DesignerEdge/DesignerEdgeArticles/ArticleID/10252/The-Past-and-Future-of-Video-Games.aspx]]
at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|http://www.stonybrook.edu/libspecial/videogames/tennis.html]],
the first video game.
Tennis for Two consisted of a 5 inch oscilloscope and
an analog computer to simiulate the physics of gravity and elasticity in real time.
And of course, some have updated the analog orginal with a
[[digital replacement|http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/resurrecting-tennis-for-two-a-video-game-from-1958/]].
