title: The Primal Force Behind IoT
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''//The Internet of Things isn't about things at all.
It's about harvesting hidden data from our physical world
and putting it to good use.//''

You have to wonder why the phenomena of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
and the Internet of Things (IoT) is happening.
What are the driving forces?
Do a quick search and you'll find many things given credit for IoT, such as:

* The cost of sensors, wireless radios, and our ability to connect them to the Internet is coming down.
* The ever expanding connectivity of the Internet into all our devices.
* The mainstreaming of cloud computing enables the IoT architecture with powerful analytics and user experience.
* Inexpensive microcontrollers and systems on a chip enable "fog" computing (i.e. smart things at the networks edge)

I believe there is a more fundamental,
a primal force, behind this movement.
I believe its rooted in the ever increasing datification of our world and our faith in the value of that data.

!Datification
[[Datification|http://www.business2community.com/big-data/the-datification-of-our-daily-lives-video-0560916#!86hej]]
is about taking an event, process, or activity,
often that was previously invisible, and turning it into data.
That data can then be tracked, monitored, and optimized, leading to new opportunities â€” and new challenges.

Cheap sensors, a ubiquitous network, and powerful processors make datification  possible,
but its our desire to digitize our world that is at the heart of it all.
We wish to convert our every physical event, thought, relationship, etc.
into data that can be stored, transported, and manipulated.

It is interesting that those evangelist who talk about datfication
(and they roll into the discussion big data)
give the very same examples as those who talk about IoT and IIoT.
They talk about it as a driving force, analogous to electrification influence on the 20^^th^^ century.
The emphasis is on how data can be used to make good decision,
analogies on how electricity can be converted to do useful physical work.

!Faith in Data
We have a strong belief, maybe at times
[[irrational belief|Our Irrational Faith in Data]],
that by harvesting raw data from our things,
or environment, or our very beings,
we can make some good use of it.
I would be the first one to say that data-driven decision-making can lead us to better outcomes,
but datifications drives use to the extreme.
We collect large volumes of data,
in the hopes that patterns and correlations will be discovered.
The tools data sciences sometimes help us tease out meaningful
information from the data,
but its sparked by a hunch, a belief that we can harvest useful things from the data we happen to be collecting.

!The Oppertunity
You can rightful attribute the IoT and IIoT to many technology trends, but the
[[first cause|http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/208087/first-cause]]
is the fact that we are obsessed with creating data
that we believe might contain hidden information.
Inexpensive sensors, processors, and networks alone would not
give us IoT and IIoT.

We now live in an age where businesses have started
feed on the massive body of facts and behaviors encoded
within the cracks and crevices of the Internet's virtual world.
IoT and IIoT will harvest similar data but now it can include the physical world.
This will also profoundly change businesses and is illustrested via the Accenture white paper
