# UriBeacon
UriBeacon (pronounced YUR-ee-BEE-kun) is evolving to become part of the
[Eddystone open beacon format](https://github.com/google/eddystone)!


# Physical Web Beacons
[Google has launched][06] the concept of the [Physical Web][04] in [Chrome][04],
on [Andriod phones][05],
and in their latest version of [Chrome for iOS][03]
The [Physical Web][01] offers a universal way to interact with any smart device
– a vending machine, a poster, a menu, a parking meter, a retail display
– without first having to download an app, where everything is just a tap away.
The Physical Web is not shipping yet nor is it an official Google product.
This is an early-stage experimental project we're developing out in the open as we do all things related to the web.

[Physical Web Browsers][02], sometimes called Beacon Scanners,
these are the tools you use to access Eddystone-URL beacon content on the Physical Web.

Eddystone, iBeacon and Bluetooth certified
