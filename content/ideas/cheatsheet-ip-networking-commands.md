Most network configuration manuals still refer to `ifconfig` and `route`
as the primary network configuration tools,
but `ifconfig` is known to behave inadequately in modern network environments.
They, and the whole [net-tools suite][15], are being deprecated,
but most Linux distros still include them.
They should be replaced by the [iproute2 suite][14].
iproute2 (usually shipped in a package called iproute or iproute2)
consists of several tools, of which the most important are `ip` and `tc`.
`ip` controls IPv4 and IPv6 configuration and `tc` stands for traffic control.
The iproute2 collection contains the following command-line utilities:
`ip`, `ss`, `bridge`, `rtacct`, `rtmon`, `tc`, `ctstat`, `lnstat`,
`nstat`, `routef`, `routel`, `rtstat`, and `arpd`.

what about ethtool, netifd, nm-tool, nmcli, nm-online

# NetworkManager
Network Manager aims for Network Connectivity which "Just Works".
The computer should use the wired network connection when it's plugged in,
but automatically switch to a wireless connection when the user unplugs it
and walks away from the desk.
Likewise, when the user plugs the computer back in,
the computer should switch back to the wired connection.
The user should, most times, not even notice that their connection has been managed for them;
they should simply see uninterrupted network connectivity.

It is the [NetworkManager][51] daemon attempts to make networking configuration
and operation as painless and automatic as possible
by managing the primary network connection and
other network interfaces, like Ethernet, WiFi, and Mobile Broadband devices.
NetworkManager will connect any network device when a connection for that device becomes available,
unless that behavior is disabled.
If using DHCP, NetworkManager is intended to replace [default routes][52],
obtain IP addresses from a [DHCP server][53], and change [name servers][54] whenever it sees fit.
In effect, the goal of NetworkManager is to make networking Just Work.

**WARNING:** [Iptables and NetworkManager can conflict][47].
NetworkManager and iptables have opposite aims.
Iptables aims to keep any questionable network traffic out.
NetworkManager aims to keep you connected at all times.
Therefore if you want security all the time,
run iptables at boot time.
If you want security some of the time then NetworkManager might be the right choice.
Network Manager is used by default in most Linux desktop environments nowadays,
but it can be disabled (see ["How to disable Network Manager on Linux"][55]),
if you prefer the old plain network service..

####################

Multicast Domain Name System (mDNS)
(http://www.multicastdns.org/) is one of the features of Bonjour, included in Mac OS X 10.2 or later.
mDNS resolves host names to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local name server.
It is a zero-configuration service,
using essentially the same programming interfaces,
packet formats and operating semantics as the unicast Domain Name System (DNS).
When an mDNS client needs to resolve a host name,
it sends an IP multicast query message that asks the host having that name to identify itself.
That target machine then multicasts a message that includes its IP address.
All machines in that subnet can then use that information to update their mDNS caches.

On the Internet at large, a DNS name such as "www.apple.com" must be resolved
to a numbered IP address before your computer can connect to the server.
A domain name system (DNS) server normally provides this name resolution service for your computer.
Your Internet service provider or network administrator normally provides a local DNS server for your use.

Conversely, mDNS allows computers on a local network, such as home or small office,
to look up each others' names and addresses without a DNS server.
Each computer knows its own name and responds to requests for that name automatically via IP multicast.

Anywhere that a you could normally use a DNS name such as "www.apple.com",
you could instead enter the Bonjour name of the computer on the local network.
To indicate that the name should be looked up using local multicast instead of a standard DNS query,
all Bonjour host names end with the extension ".local."
This helps avoid confusion between names that are local Bonjour computer names
("mycomputer.local") and globally unique DNS names ("www.apple.com").

# SSH - Remote Unix Work
[Tips for remote Unix work: SSH, screen, and VNC](http://shebang.brandonmintern.com/tips-for-remote-unix-work-ssh-screen-and-vnc/)

# Establishing a Connection
You can use `iw` to connect to an AP directly if and only if the AP has:

* No encryption
* Uses WEP for encryption

If you need to connect to an AP with WPA or WPA2 encryption,
then you must use [`wpa_supplicant`][03].

```bash
# connect to an AP that has encryption disabled, where its SSID is foo
iw wlan0 connect foo

# if you have two APs with the SSID foo, and you know the one you want to
# connect to is on the frequency 2432, you can specify the frequency to use
iw wlan0 connect foo 2432

# connect to an AP that uses WEP, you can use:
iw wlan0 connect foo keys 0:abcde d:1:0011223344
```

# WiFi Status and Configuration
All WiFi dongles are not the same.
They differ in performance based upon the chip set used in their design.
You can assess details about the capability of your WiFi dongle via [`iw`][02].
`iw` is a new CLI configuration utility for wireless devices.
The old tool `iwconfig` is deprecated, never the less, you might still find it in use.

```bash
# list information about the currently associated wireless network
$ iwconfig wlan0
wlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:"74LL5"
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.462 GHz  Access Point: 00:12:93:A4:8A:F0
          Bit Rate=54 Mb/s   Tx-Power=27 dBm
          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:on
          Link Quality=63/70  Signal level=-47 dBm
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:5471   Missed beacon:0
$
```

First thing is to get device capabilities for all devices:

```bash
# get device capabilities for all devices, such as band information (2.4 GHz, and 5 GHz),
# and 802.11n information
iw list
```

The next step is to see what wireless networks are available in your area.
A utility called `iwlist` provides all sorts of information about your wireless environment.
To scan your environment for available networks, do the following:

```bash
# scanning for an access point
sudo iwlist wlan0 scan

# alternative
sudo iw dev wlan0 scan
```

To listen to events concerning you WiFi link, use these commands:

```bash
# listening to events
iw event

# see the auth/assoc/deauth/disassoc frames
iw event -f

# timing information is added
iw event -t
```

To determine if you are connected to an AP (or not), and if you are the
last TX rate used you can use the command below:

```bash
# getting link status
iw dev wlan0 link
```

# Getting Station Statistics
To get station statistic information such as the amount of tx/rx bytes,
the last TX bit rate (including [MCS values][05]) you can do:

```bash
$ iw dev wlan0 station dump
Station 00:1f:90:b4:8a:80 (on wlan0)
	inactive time:	7976 ms
	rx bytes:	29886939
	rx packets:	419177
	tx bytes:	49091
	tx packets:	1535
	tx retries:	18
	tx failed:	0
	signal:  	-43 dBm
	signal avg:	-43 dBm
	tx bitrate:	48.0 MBit/s
	authorized:	yes
	authenticated:	yes
	preamble:	long
	WMM/WME:	no
	MFP:		no
	TDLS peer:		no
```

* **TDLS**, or Tunneled Direct Link Setup is a technology that enables devices to
link directly to one another when connected to a traditional WiFi network.
* **WMM/WME**, or Wireless Multimedia Extensions (WME), also known as WiFi Multimedia (WMM),
provides basic Quality of service (QoS) features to IEEE 802.11 networks.

If you want to get specific statistics against a peer you station is
communicating with you can use the following:

```bash
sudo iw dev wlan1 station get <peer-MAC-address>
```

In the case of a STA the above <peer-MAC-address>
would be the MAC address of your AP.

# Setting TX Power

```bash
# set the txpower by using either the device interface name of the respective phy.
iw dev <devname> set txpower <auto|fixed|limit> [<tx power in mBm>]
iw phy <phyname> set txpower <auto|fixed|limit> [<tx power in mBm>]
```

IEEE-802.11 was designed with [`power saving`][04] in mind for stations.
To assist stations with power saving, Access Points (APs) are designed to buffer frames
for a station when that station is in power save mode and
to transmit them later to the station when the AP knows the station will listen.
When a station is in power save mode, it turns off its transmitter and receiver to preserve energy.
It takes less power for a station to turn its receiver on to listen to
frames than to turn it its transmitter on to transmit frames.
For this reason, it's more power-efficient for an AP to inform a station if it has
buffered frames present on the AP than to have the station poll the AP querying if frames are present.

```bash
# to enable power save by default
sudo iw dev wlan0 set power_save on

# to query the current power save settings
iw dev wlan0 get power_save
```

# Setting Frequency or Channel
```bash
# set frequency
iw dev wlan0 set freq 2412 [HT20|HT40+|HT40-]

# set channel
iw dev wlan0 set channel 1 [HT20|HT40+|HT40-]
```

# IBSS / Ad-Hoc Networks
```bash
# join an IBSS / ad-hoc network
iw wlan0 set type ibss
iw wlan0 ibss join foo-adhoc 2412

# leaving an IBSS / ad-hoc network
iw wlan0 ibss leave
```

# What Devices Are Connected to Your Network
An easy way to scan your network to see what device are connected is to use [`nmap`][01].
With this you can find out if some unknown or unwanted device is connected to it.

Despite its popularity as a utility for network discovery and security auditing,
`nmap` isn't part of the base install for Ubuntu.
To install it, just do

    sudo apt-get install nmap

To begin your scan using `nmap -sP`,
which will run a ping scan on the specified network.
For instance, `nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24` will scan the 256 hosts from
192.168.1.0 through 192.168.1.255 to see if they're available, and report back.

```bash
# ????
sudo nmap -v -sL 192.168.1.0/24

# ping scan on the specified network
sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
```

To check to see what services are running on a box

```bash
# list what services are running
sudo nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
```

# Routing
_Routing_ is a means of sending an IP packet from one point to another.
In computer networking, a _router_ is a device responsible for forwarding network traffic.
On Linux and UNIX systems,
information on how packets are to be forwarded is stored in a
kernel structure called a _routing table_.
In effect, a routing table is a set of rules,
that is used to determine where data packets, traveling over an IP network, will be directed.
All IP-enabled devices, including computer hosts, routers, and switches, use routing tables.

Today, most of the multiuser systems (aka hosts) can be configured to act as a router.
So, a common routing algorithm can be specified that can be used by the router as well as by a host.
When a host can act like a router,
it is generally said that the host has an _embedded router_ functionality.
Such a host which has an embedded router functionality,
should never forward datagrams until and unless configured to do so (i.e. configured to act like a router).

The routing table can be used for both _static routing_ and _dynamic routing_.
Dynamic routing consists of the kernel making decisions as to which route,
out of multiple present routes, a packet should take.
Static routing is a form of routing that occurs when a router
uses a manually-configured routing entry,
rather than information from a dynamic routing protocol to forward traffic.

The data in routing table contains the following main entries:

Destination IP address
:   This  field represents the IP address of the destination.
    This IP address could be the address of a single host or could that be of a network.
IP address of next router
:   This entry gives the IP address of the next router which decides how to
    further send an IP data gram received on its interface.
Flags
:   This field provides information like destination IP address (specified above)
    is a host address or a network address or convey whether the next router
    (specified above) is really a next router or a directly connected interface.
Network interface specs
:   Some specification about the network interface the datagram should
    be passed for further transmission.

For further information and education, see

* [Introduction to Linux IP Routing Fundamentals (Part 1)](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/04/ip-routing-intro/)

## Display the Routing Table
Each entry is nothing but an entry in the routing table (Linux kernel routing table).

```bash
# display the kernel routing table
$ sudo route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth1
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 eth1

# using netstat
$ netstat -r
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
default         Wireless_Broadb 0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth1
192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth1

# the -n option means that you want numerical IP addresses displayed
$ netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth1
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth1
```

The output provides a detailed information in the destination IP addresses and their gateways.
The flag â€˜Uâ€™ suggests that the route is up,
and the flag â€˜Gâ€™ suggests that the router is to a gateway (router).
If this flag is not set then it can be assumed that the destination is directly connected.

```bash
# using the iproute2 suite
$ ip route list
default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth1  proto static
192.168.1.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.1.4  metric 1
```

# Firewall
Linux comes with a host based [firewall][39] called [`netfilter`][36]
(or sometimes called "iptables" after the tool used to manage netfilter).
`netfilter` is a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows
kernel modules to register callback functions with the network stack.
A registered callback function is then called back for every packet
that traverses the respective hook within the network stack.
This Linux based firewall is controlled by the program called [`iptables`][37]
to handles filtering for IPv4, and [`ip6tables`][38] handles filtering for IPv6.
When you install Ubuntu, `iptables` is there,
but it allows all traffic by default.
The websites [IptablesHowTo][47] and [Linux: 20 Iptables Examples For New SysAdmins][48]
provide a quick intro to `iptables` for Ubuntu.
When exposing your server to the Internet,
having an [effective Firewall policy is very important to secure your sever][49].
The website ["How To Set Up a Firewall Using Iptables on Ubuntu 14.04"][50]
can help you set up your Firewall.

Ubuntu has `iptables` but also comes with [`ufw`][45]
and is considered the default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu.
There is also a graphical version [`gufw`][46] can be installed with `sudo apt-get install gufw`.
Developed to ease `iptables` firewall configuration,
`ufw` provides a user friendly way to create an IPv4 or IPv6 host-based firewall.
By default `ufw` is disabled.

## Understanding Firewall Chains
Managed via `iptables`, there are total 3 default rule chains established for `netfilter`:

**Rules Chains**

* **INPUT** - The default chain is used for packets addressed to the system. Use this to open or close incoming ports (such as 80,25, and 110 etc) and ip addresses / subnet (such as 202.54.1.20/29).
* **OUTPUT** - The default chain is used when packets are generating from the system. Use this open or close outgoing ports and ip addresses / subnets.
* **FORWARD** - The default chains is used when packets send through another interface. Usually used when you setup Linux as router. For example, eth0 connected to ADSL/Cable modem and eth1 is connected to local LAN. Use FORWARD chain to send and receive traffic from LAN to the Internet.

**Packet Matching Rules**

1. Each packet starts at the first rule in the chain.
1. A packet proceeds until it matches a rule.
1. If a match found, then control will jump to the specified target (such as REJECT, ACCEPT, DROP).

***Target Meanings**

1. The target **ACCEPT** means allow packet.
1. The target **REJECT** means to drop the packet and send an error message to remote host.
1. The target **DROP** means drop the packet and do not send an error message to remote host or sending host.

## Displaying the Status of Firewall
To inspect firewall with line numbers, enter:

```bash
# firewall status with line numbers
sudo iptables -n -L -v --line-numbers
```

Where,

* **-L** : List rules.
* **-v** : Display detailed information. This option makes the list command show the interface name, the rule options, and the TOS masks. The packet and byte counters are also listed, with the suffix 'K', 'M' or 'G' for 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 multipliers respectively.
* **-n** : Display IP address and port in numeric format. Do not use DNS to resolve names. This will speed up listing.

## Block All Network Traffic
This will block all incoming and outgoing traffic including Internet.

```bash
# block absolutely all traffic, including SSH
iptable -F
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
```

**Do not enter above command over remote ssh login session.**

If you want to block all incoming traffic to your system __except__
ssh connection under Linux,
do the following:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# My system IP/set ip address of server
SERVER_IP="65.55.12.13"

# Flushing all rules
iptables -F
iptables -X

# Setting default filter policy
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP

# Allow unlimited traffic on loopback
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

# Allow incoming ssh only
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 0/0 -d $SERVER_IP --sport 513:65535 --dport 22 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -s $SERVER_IP -d 0/0 --sport 22 --dport 513:65535 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# make sure nothing comes or goes out of this box
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP
```

This script only allows incoming ssh.
No other incoming service or ping request or no outgoing service or request allowed.
Incoming ssh connection can be either new or already established one
and that is what specified by state rule '-m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED'.
Outgoing ssh connection state can be established only.
By default this script allows everyone to ssh in by rule -s 0/0.
If you want this access limited by IP or network address then replace -s 0/0 with IP address.

## Insert Firewall Rules
To insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule number use the following syntax.
First find out line numbers, enter:

```bash
sudo iptables -L INPUT -n --line-numbers
```

Sample outputs:

```bash
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
num  target     prot opt source               destination
1    DROP       all  --  202.54.1.1           0.0.0.0/0
2    ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           state NEW,ESTABLISHED
```

To insert rule between 1 and 2, enter:

```bash
# insert rule between 1 and 2
iptables -I INPUT 2 -s 202.54.1.2 -j DROP
```

To view updated rules, enter:

```bash
iptables -L INPUT -n --line-numbers
```

Sample outputs:

```bash
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
num  target     prot opt source               destination
1    DROP       all  --  202.54.1.1           0.0.0.0/0
2    DROP       all  --  202.54.1.2           0.0.0.0/0
3    ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
```

## Delete Firewall Rules
To display line number along with other information for existing rules, enter:

```bash
# firewall status with line numbers
sudo iptables -n -L -v --line-numbers
```

You will get the list of IP.
Look at the number on the left, then use number to delete it.
For example delete line number 4, enter:

```bash
# delete iptable rule number 4
sudo iptables -D INPUT 4
```

or find source IP 202.54.1.1 and delete from rule:

```bash
# delete INPUT rule associated with IP 202.54.1.1
sudo iptables -D INPUT -s 202.54.1.1 -j DROP
```

Where,

* **-D** : Delete one or more rules from the selected chain

## Drop or Accept Traffic From Mac Address
Use the following syntax:

```bash
# drop packets from mac 00:0F:EA:91:04:08
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m mac --mac-source 00:0F:EA:91:04:08 -j DROP

# only accept traffic for TCP port 8080 from mac 00:0F:EA:91:04:07
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 22 -m mac --mac-source 00:0F:EA:91:04:07 -j ACCEPT
```

## Open Range of Ports or IP Addresses
Use the following syntax to open a range of ports:

```bash
# open the ports from 7000 to 7010
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 7000:7010 -j ACCEPT
```

Use the following syntax to open a range of IP address:

```bash
# only accept connection to tcp port 80 (Apache) if ip is between 192.168.1.100 and 192.168.1.200
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -m iprange --src-range 192.168.1.100-192.168.1.200 -j ACCEPT

# nat example
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.1.20-192.168.1.25
```

## Restrict the Number of Parallel Connections To a Server Per Client IP
You can use connlimit module to put such restrictions.
To allow 3 ssh connections per client host,
or restric HTTP requests, enter:

```bash
# allow 3 ssh connections per client host
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 22 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 3 -j REJECT

# set HTTP requests to 20:
sudo iptables -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 20 --connlimit-mask 24 -j DROP
```

Where,

* **--connlimit-above 3** : Match if the number of existing connections is above 3.
* **--connlimit-mask 24** : Group hosts using the prefix length. For IPv4,
this must be a number between (including) 0 and 32.

## Testing Your Firewall
Find out if ports are open or not, enter:

```bash
# identify what ports are open
netstat -tulpn

# find out if tcp port 80 open or not, enter:
netstat -tulpn | grep :80

# if port 80 is not open, start Apache
service httpd start

# make sure iptables allowing access to the port 80
# iptables -L INPUT -v -n | grep 80
```

## Saving iptables Rules
If you were to reboot your machine right after modifing your firewall,
your iptables configuration would disappear.
Rather than type this each time you reboot, however, you can save the configuration,
and have it start up automatically.
To save the configuration, you can use `iptables-save` and `iptables-restore`.
`iptables` stores the rules in memory but the ruleset created by
`iptables-save ruleset-name` can be used to store you rules in a safe place.

```bash
# dump iptables rules to stdout
sudo iptables-save

# dump iptable rules to a file so they can be restored later
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

# restore iptable rules from file
sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```
For Ubuntu, to load the `iptables` rules files on boot up,
there is a package with the name `iptables-persistent`
which does the task of automatic loading of the saved `iptables` rules.
To do this, the rules must be saved in the file `/etc/iptables/rules.v4` for IPv4
and `/etc/iptables/rules.v6` for IPv6.

For use, the `iptables-persistent` package must simply be installed.

```bash
sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent
```

## Logging Traffic
If you would like to log dropped packets to syslog,
this would be the quickest way:

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT 5 -m limit --limit 5/min -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables denied: " --log-level 7
```

## Flush / Remove All iptables Rules
Create the script `/root/fw.stop` using text editor:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "Stopping firewall and allowing everyone..."

## Failsafe - die if /sbin/iptables not found
[ ! -x "$ipt" ] && { echo "$0: \"${ipt}\" command not found."; exit 1; }

iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

iptables -F
iptables -X

iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t nat -X

iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -t mangle -X

iptables iptables -t raw -F
iptables -t raw -X
```

Make sure you can execute the script via
`sudo chmod +x /root/fw.stop`
and then run the script as root user
`sudo /root/fw.stop`.

You can verify that firewall rules are flushed out via:
`iptables -L -n -v`
which should show that all chains will "ACCEPT" packets.

## Protect Your Network from Spamming, Scanning, etc.
[DROP (Don't Route Or Peer)][40] is an advisory "drop all traffic" list,
consisting of stolen 'zombie' netblocks and netblocks controlled entirely by professional spammers.

# WiFi Definitions and Concepts
All components that can connect into a wireless medium in a network are referred to as **stations**.
All stations are equipped with wireless network interface controllers (WNICs).
Wireless stations fall into one of two categories: wireless access points, and clients.

* **Access Points (APs)**, normally wireless routers, are base stations for the wireless network.
They transmit and receive radio frequencies for wireless enabled devices to communicate with.
* Wireless **clients** can be mobile devices such as laptops, personal digital assistants,
IP phones and other smartphones, or fixed devices such as desktops and workstations
that are equipped with a wireless network interface.

* **SoftAP** is short for Software enabled Access Point.
This is software that turns a computer that was not specifically made to be a
router into a Wireless Access Point.
It is often used interchangeably with the term "virtual router".
The advantage of SoftAP is the use of a regular cellphone,
for example, with a client antenna and data connection as an
Access Point to serve other wireless devices which do not have a data connection otherwise.
The wireless devices in the vicinity of the SoftAP enabled device,
which may not have the Internet access directly,
can use the Internet through the cellphone whose SoftAP is enabled.
This is called tethering.

The **basic service set (BSS)** is a set of all stations that can communicate with each other.
Every BSS has an identification (ID) called the BSSID,
which is the MAC address of the access point servicing the BSS.
There are two types of BSS:Independent BSS (also referred to as IBSS), and infrastructure BSS.

* An **independent BSS (IBSS)** is an ad hoc network that contains no access points,
which means they can not connect to any other basic service set (BSS).
* An **infrastructure BSS** can connect with other basic service set (BSS).

An **extended service set (ESS)** is a set of connected BSSs.
Access points in an ESS are connected by a distribution system.
Each ESS has an ID called the **SSID** which is a 32-byte (maximum) character string.

### Types of Wireless LANs
The IEEE 802.11 has two basic modes of operation: ad hoc mode and infrastructure mode.

* In **ad hoc mode**, mobile units transmit directly peer-to-peer.
There is no base and no one gives permission to talk.
This is accomplished using the Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS).
* In **infrastructure mode**, mobile units communicate through an access point that serves
as a bridge to other networks (such as Internet or LAN).

A **[WiFi Direct][06]**, also called WiFi P2P, network is another type of network where stations communicate peer to peer.
In a WiFi Direct group, the group owner operates as an access point and all other devices are clients.
There are two main methods to establish a group owner in the WiFi Direct group.

* In one approach, the user sets up a P2P group owner manually.
This method is also known as **Autonomous Group Owner** (autonomous GO).
* In the second method, also called **negotiation-based group creation**,
two devices compete based on the group owner intent value.
The device with higher intent value becomes a group owner and the second device becomes a client.
Group owner intent value can depend on whether the wireless device performs a
cross-connection between an infrastructure WLAN service and a P2P group,
remaining power in the wireless device, whether the wireless device is already a group owner in another group
and/or a received signal strength of the first wireless device.

A **bridge** can be used to connect networks, typically of different types.
A wireless Ethernet bridge allows the connection of devices on a wired Ethernet network to a wireless network.
The bridge acts as the connection point to the Wireless LAN.

A **wireless distribution system (WDS)** is a system enabling the wireless interconnection
of access points in an IEEE 802.11 network.
It allows a wireless network to be expanded using multiple access points without the
traditional requirement for a wired backbone to link them.

# Traffic Shaping
Traffic Shaping (a.k.a Bandwidth Shaping or Packet Shaping)
is an attempt to control network traffic by prioritizing network resources
and guarantee certain bandwidth based on predefined policy rules.
Traffic shaping uses concepts of traffic classification, policy rules,
queue disciplines and quality of service (QoS).

http://www.iplocation.net/tools/traffic-control.php

# Test for Internet Speed
You determine your Internet download speed right from a terminal window
by using the `wget` command to pull a file from a remote server.
The speed is displayed in the terminal when the file download has completed

```bash
$ wget -O /dev/null http://speedtest.wdc01.softlayer.com/downloads/test10.zip
