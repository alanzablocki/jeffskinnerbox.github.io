# Crystal Radio
A crystal radio is basically a high Q resonator tied to an antenna and an envelope detector.
These days the envelope detector is a point contact diode such as a 1N34 Germanium diode.

The resonant circuit passes a specific wavelength (or more specifically range of wavelengths depending on its Q). The diode detector provides the amplitude or envelope of the signal(s) within that wavelength. A high impedance or highly sensitive ear piece converts this envelope to an audible signal that you can listen to.

The neat thing about crystal radios is that no active RF amplification is used. The radio is powered by the incoming radio signal that it is tuned to. More sophisticated crystal sets might have more than one tuned stage, perhaps 3 or 4 to minimize receiver bandwidth for maximum sensitivity and selectivity.

The primary receiver used on the Titanic’s Marconi station was basically a 3-stage crystal radio except that it used a magnetic detector rather than a semiconductor
