The technology allows things to talk to the Internet without 3G or WiFi.
It features low battery usage, long range and low bandwidth. Perfect for the Internet of Things.

Long-Range Low-Power - http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/lora-technology

[LoRaWAN][01] (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
specification intended for wireless battery operated Things in regional, national or global network.
It is a media access control (MAC) protocol for long range network
based on [LoRa][01] (Long Range) radio modulation technique.
In the OSI Reference Model, LoRa represent layer 1 (PHY), and LoRaWAN roughly maps to layers 2 and 3.
LoRaWAN networks use a star-of-stars topology in which gateways forward messages between nodes and applications in the backend. Nodes use a single-hop wireless connection to one or more gateways.
