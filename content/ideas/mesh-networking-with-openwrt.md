Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol for IPv6 and IPv4 with fast convergence properties.

# Broadband-Hamnet / HSMM-MESH
[Broadband-Hamnet][02] (formerly called HSMM-Mesh) is a high speed, self discovering,
self configuring, fault tolerant,
wireless computer network that can run for days from a fully charged car battery,
or indefinitely with the addition of a modest solar array or other supplemental power source.
The focus is on emergency communications.
In its current form it is built using the Linksys WRT54G/GL/GS wireless routers
and operates on channels 1-6 of the 2.4GHz ISM band,
which overlaps with the upper portion of the 13cm amateur radio band.
Other platforms and bands are in development at this time.
Next will be Ubiquiti equipment with others supported as development resources permit.
