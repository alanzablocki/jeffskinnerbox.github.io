Hard apple cider is the kindest of the do-it-yourself homemade alcoholic beverages.
Beer must be cumbersomely boiled, wine is expensive,
and poorly distilled spirits can blow up your house.
They all take so much equipment, so much research, and give all the beer, wine, and spirits
on the market, why bother.
On the other hand, hard cider is a relative cakewalk and worth while doing.
I have purchased some very good hard apple cider, only to find that where I purchase
it no longer carries it.
Also, I have developed a taste for a specific style of hard cider.
I crave a hard cider that isn't clear (I think the yeast can add something to the taste),
high alcohol level (ABV of 8% or more), 
slightly sweet,
and a crisp apple taste.
Frankly, I have yet to purchase my ideal hard apple cider.

There may be some regulatory reasons for my disappointment in the hard cider I purchase.
The web site, [The Hard Cider Project][01], posted a article titled
"[Why Federal Regulations Have Completely Restricted Hard Cider Making][02]".
The basic thesis is that
[Title 27: Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Part 24 Wine, ยง24.10 Meaning of terms][03]
of the Federal Regulations defines hard cider into a narrow category.
It restricts both its alcohol content (< 7% ABV) and things that can be added
(can't add anything that imparts a fruit flavor other than apple).
The result is not a very exciting hard cider, otherwise your subject to
higher taxes because the Feds call it wine or champagne.
