Hard apple cider is the kindest of the do-it-yourself homemade alcoholic beverages.
Beer must be cumbersomely boiled, wine is expensive,
and poorly distilled spirits can blow up your house.
They all take so much equipment, so much research, and give all the beer, wine, and spirits
on the market, why bother.
On the other hand, hard cider is a relative cakewalk and worth while doing.
I have purchased some very good hard apple cider, only to find that where I purchase
it no longer carries it.
Also, I have developed a taste for a specific style of hard cider.
I crave a hard cider that isn't clear (I think the yeast can add something to the taste),
high alcohol level (ABV of 8% or more), 
slightly sweet,
and a crisp apple taste.
Frankly, I have yet to purchase my ideal hard apple cider.
