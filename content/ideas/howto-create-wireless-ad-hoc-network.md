A [wireless ad-hoc network (WANET)][02] is a decentralized type of wireless network.
The network is ad-hoc because it does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure,
such as routers in wired networks or [access points][01] in managed (infrastructure) wireless networks.
Each node participates in routing by forwarding data for other nodes,
and this is done dynamically on the basis of network connectivity.
Wireless ad-hoc networks are self-configuring, dynamic networks in which nodes are free to move,
enabling devices to create and join networks "on the fly".
