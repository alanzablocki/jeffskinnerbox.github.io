show how to check for WiFi network status

A [wireless ad-hoc network (WANET)][02],
also known as Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS),
is a decentralized type of wireless network.
The network is ad-hoc because it does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure,
such as routers in wired networks or [access points][01] in managed (infrastructure) wireless networks.
Wireless stations communicate directly with one another on a peer-to-peer basis,
without using an access point or any intermediate network router.

[Wireless Tools for Linux and Linux Wireless Extension][03]
are a collection of user-space utilities
written for Linux to support and facilitate
the configuration of device drivers of wireless network interface controllers.

# Step XXX: Finding a Quite WiFi Channel
The first step is to see what wireless networks are available in your area.
The utility `iwlist` provides all sorts of information about your wireless environment.
To scan your environment for available networks, do the following:

```bash
# scan for wifi networks
$ sudo iwlist wlan0 scan

wlan0     Scan completed :

                              .
```

To see what channels are being used or list network SSID, try this:

```bash
# list the wifi channels being used
$ sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep \(Channel
                    Frequency:2.412 GHz (Channel 1)
                    Frequency:2.412 GHz (Channel 1)
                    Frequency:2.412 GHz (Channel 1)
                    Frequency:2.437 GHz (Channel 6)
                    Frequency:2.437 GHz (Channel 6)

# list the ssid of the networks
$ sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep ESSID
                    ESSID:"74LL5"
                    ESSID:"SQLKL"
                    ESSID:""
                    ESSID:"hpsetup"
                    ESSID:"NETGEAR10"
```

To find out which channels are congested, the command below
lists how many networks are on each channel:

```bash
# lists how many networks are on each channel
$ sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep Frequency | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
      2                     Frequency:2.437 GHz (Channel 6)
      3                     Frequency:2.412 GHz (Channel 1)
```
