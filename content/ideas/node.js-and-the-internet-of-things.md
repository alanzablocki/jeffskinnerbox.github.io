Node.js is good for apps where the server side is serving web services being called by many clients.
Because it uses non blocking io,
it can serve a lot more requests simultaneously on the same hardware
Since IoT is progressng towards lots of small clients making web service calls to the server,
Node.js is a good fit.
Node.js basically makes the web server more efficient by eliminating the need for thousands of blocked threads.
Instead of having one thread per request,
you can have one thread serve hundreds of requests in a non blocking manner.
Mind you, it's not just Node.js,
it's the whole stack that has to be able support high volume of web service requests. Node js is a piece of it.
