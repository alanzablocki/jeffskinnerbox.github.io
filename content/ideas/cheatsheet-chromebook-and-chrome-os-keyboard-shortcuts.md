# Working with Chromebook / Chrome OS
Switching from a PC to a Chromebook comes with a few adjustments.
For one, you’ll need to have access to a WiFi signal for most Chrome apps to function.
Also, the Chromebook doesn't have a standard PC keyboard (e.g. no Page Up / Down keys).
There is also a number of keyboard shortcuts you’ll need to learn,
and touchpad motions that are different from the average PC.

* Click the touchpad with two fingers to open the **right-click menu** .
* Place two fingers on the touchpad and move up and down or right to left to **scroll**.
* Click and hold on an item you want to **drag and drop** using one finger. Then, with a second finger move to where you want that item dropped.
* Swipe left or right quickly using two fingers to **switch between open tabs**.

# Keyboard Shortcuts
Google's Chrome OS uses some familiar keyboard shortcuts as well as some unique ones.
A few of these access Chrome OS settings
and others take the place of missing physical keys on Chromebook keyboards
( e.g. Page Up, Page Down, Home, End).

Full list of Chromebook's [Keyboard shortcuts][42].

**NOTE:** You can actually create as many shells as you want.
Just hit `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`T` again and a second shell will be opened.

cosh has two separate versions of help.
you can access basic help in the crosh window by simple typing `help`.
