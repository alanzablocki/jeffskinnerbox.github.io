# Publishing to GitHub Page
[GitHub can create a websites from a repository][29] and this is call GitHub Pages.
There are [two types of GitHub Pages][30]: Project Pages and User Pages.
Pelican can can handle both but this is for User Pages.
We are using User Pages here.
Check out [A guide to using Github Pages][33] for more information.

To publish a Pelican site in the form of User Pages,
you need to `git push` the content of the output dir generated by Pelican
to the `master` branch of your `<site-name>.github.io` repository on GitHub.
The utility [`ghp-import`][02] (installed with `easy_install` or `pip`) can makes this easy.

It basically goes like this

    pelican content -o output -s pelicanconf.py
    ghp-import output
    git push git@github.com:mysite/mysite.github.io.git gh-pages:master

The git push command pushes the local gh-pages branch
(freshly updated by the `ghp-import` command)
to the `mysite.github.io` repository’s master branch on GitHub.

### Creating Your Local Git Repository
Change to the `~/blogging` directory, and initialize it as a git repository
 
    cd ~/blogging
    git init
 
Add all the files, and make initial comment

    git add .
    git commit -m 'Initial commit'

### Creating the GitHub Repository
Goto GitHub and create the new repository

    goto https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox
    <create empty repository called 'jeffskinnerbox.github.io'>

### Publish Pelican Site
To publish a Pelican site in the form of User Pages,
you need to push the content of the `output` directory (i.e. the HTML created for the website)
generated by Pelican to the master branch of your `<username>.github.io` repository on GitHub.

    pelican content -o output -s publishconf.py
    ghp-import output
    git push origin gh-pages:master

Using `ghp-import` will over write your local `gh-pages` branch and the remote GitHub `master` branch.
In effect, GitHub's `master` branch will maintain the website's current content, but no history.

### Post the Website Source to GitHub
I do want maintain a historical record of the website's source materials (i.e. the markdown files).
To place the source materials for the website into GitHub,
I'll use standard git procedures (i.e. no use of `ghp-import`).
See below for the procedure used:

    git add --all
    git commit -m "<comment>"
    git push origin master:source

The `git push` command pushes the local `master` branch
(which contains the source materials for the website) to the `<username>.github.io`
repository’s `source` branch on GitHub.

### Loading the GitHub Repository for the First Time
Within the `~/blogging` directory, use git to load the files to GitHub
 
    git remote add origin https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/jeffskinnerbox.github.io

### To Update the Local Git Repository
Within the `~/blogging` directory, do a "get status" to see what will be included in the commit,
add files (or remove) that are required, and then do the commit to the local git repository.

    git status
    git add --all
    git commit --dry-run
    git commit -m <comment>

### To Update the Remote (i.e. GitHub) Repository
To which shows you the URL that Git has stored for the shortname to for
the remote (GitHub) repository:

    git remote -v

Now to push your files to the GitHub repository

    git push -u origin master





# Random Notes

## To Do
Read the following:

* [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Google Webmasters Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/)
* [Google Guidelines](http://www.feedthebot.com/)
* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/)
* []()

To test out the web site, use the command `jekyll serve --watch --drafts`
and then go to `http://localhost:4000/`.

## Licensing
I have opted to go with the [MIT License][01]. 
This seems like an important decision
(at least its important to keep the lawyers away from your door),
but how does one make the call?
I found the following sites useful:

* [Choosing an OSS license doesn’t need to be scary](http://choosealicense.com/)
